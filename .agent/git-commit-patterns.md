# Commit Rules & Guidelines

Simple rules for making commits in HotelOrin project.

---

## 📦 Commit Grouping Rules

### Maximum Files per Commit: 5
- **Group related files** that implement a complete feature
- **Keep commits focused** on one specific change
- **Don't mix unrelated changes** in the same commit

### When to Group Files:
- ✅ Same feature implementation (Model + Resource + Controller + Request + Component)
- ✅ Related bug fixes across multiple files
- ✅ Refactoring that affects multiple related components

### When to Commit Separately:
- ✅ Isolated bug fixes
- ✅ Documentation updates
- ✅ Style changes
- ✅ Unrelated features

---

## 🏷️ Commit Message Format

### Structure:
```
type: brief description

- bullet point for each file/change
- keep it concise and clear
```

### Commit Types:
- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes  
- `refactor:` Code improvements
- `docs:` Documentation
- `test:` Test updates
- `style:` Code style
- `perf:` Performance
- `chore:` Maintenance

## 📝 Examples

### ✅ Good - Grouped Related Files:
```

```

## 🔄 Workflow

4. **Test your changes**

```
